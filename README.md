# Project-5-MasterRubyInsane

# Description
Design a web page that looks and behaves like a classic calculator.  

# Managers
Overall project manager: Sam Cubberly  
Meeting manager: Oliver Shen

# Use Cases
- [Basic] Entering Numbers  
    - The user clicks on the number buttons (0-9)  
    - Digits added to equation  
[Basic] Entering Basic Operations and Functions  
    - The user clicks a number, an operator (+, -, *, /), another number  
    - The user clicks a function  
        - Square root, exponentiation  
        - trigonometry  
    - The user clicks a parenthesis  
    - These added to the equation  
- [Basic] Equation Displayed on Screen  
    - The equation being typed can be seen by the user in real time as a string  
- [Basic] Calculation and display  
    - If you hit the equals button, the equation will be computed  
    - The value will be displayed
- [Basic] Memory and history
    - Memory and history stored, and can be shown when their respective buttons
- [Basic] Clearing Input or memory
    - The user clicks the "C" button to clear the current input and display.
    - The user clicks the "MC" button to clear the value stored in memory.
- [Basic] Backspace
    - Allows to remove one character from the display / equation string
- [Optional] Mode switching (e.g., hexadecimal, binary, decimal)
    - Allows to see the value in different modes
